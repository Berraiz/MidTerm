    <P>Hello, my name is Jao Ferraz Neves , and this is my Cultural Conections webpage, im going to talk a little bit about myself.</P>


    <div>
        <h4>Cultural Shock</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>When i arrived in canada, the language was cold, compared how Brazilians would speak, in english the language is pretty straight foward</li> 
            <li>After a few weeks i notice that everybody carry and umbrella here, its because of the rain, even in sunnyday you see people carrying a umbrella</li>
        </ol>
        <h4> Miss From Brazil</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>"altinha" its a brazilian soccer game, its based on not letting the ball touch the ground, you usually use a lot of head, shoulder, feet and chest to play this game, its really fun </li>
            <li>The second thing i miss the most, would be "Feijoada", a tradicional Brazilian Dish based on beans and pig meat</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Canada is Amazing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The way Canada System works, its really amazing compared to Brazil, even with a lot of problems, everything here works as it should, for exempla bus, skytrain, everything</li>
            <li>Really good Pubs around vancouver, and a lot type of beers, they made with a lot ingredients so every time its a new experiencie</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>My Goal in life</h4><br>
        <p>I came to Canada to build a better life and expand my future opportunities through my studies. The knowledge and skills
        I gain here will be highly valued by Brazilian companies, making my qualifications even more competitive and appreciated
        back home.</p>
